# Our Machinery: Guidebook

Since the Our Machinery project ended abruptly, there is no way to access there website again.

There used to be a guidebook, to help architectural design during the development process. Thanks to the Wayback Machine project, we can get the old guidebook with the command:

```bash
curl https://web.archive.org/web/20220127004837/https://ourmachinery.com/files/guidebook.md.html
```

The file in this repo is slightly modified to have only the markdown part extracted.
